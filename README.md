# IUCr Core CIF development repository

This repository is for review and development of the IUCr core CIF
dictionary and supplementary dictionaries which COMCIFS manages.

Dictionary definitions are described using DDLm attributes, which
are themselves described in 'ddl.dic'. 

Contributions through Github mechanisms are welcome. Please clone this repository and create a pull request.
Alternatively, you can contact the COMCIFS coordinating secretary (bm at iucr.org) or 
[submit suggestions through the IUCr website](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/new-item).
