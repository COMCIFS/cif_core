      _pd_block.id is used to assign a unique ID code to a data block.
      This code is then used for references between different blocks
      (see _pd_block.diffractogram_id, _pd_calib.std_external_block_id
      and _pd_phase.block_id).
 
      Note that a data block may contain only a single diffraction
      data set or information about a single crystalline phase.
      However, a single diffraction measurement may yield structural
      information on more than one phase, or a single structure
      determination may use more than one data set. Alternatively,
      results from a single data set, such as calibration parameters
      from measurements of a standard, may be used for many subsequent
      analyses. Through use of the ID code, a reference made between
      data sets may be preserved when the file is exported from the
      laboratory from which the CIF originated.
 
      The ID code assigned to each data block should be unique with
      respect to an ID code assigned for any other data block in the
      world. The naming scheme chosen for the block-ID format is
      designed to ensure uniqueness.
 
      It is the responsibility of a data archive site or local
      laboratory to create a catalogue of block ID's if that site
      wishes to resolve these references.

      A block ID code (see _pd_block.id) that identifies
      diffraction data contained in a data block other
      than the current block. This will occur most frequently
      when more than one set of diffraction data
      is used for a structure determination. The data
      block containing the diffraction data will contain
      a _pd_block.id code matching the code in
      _pd_block.diffractogram_id.

      Used to assign a unique character string to a block.
      Note that this code is not intended to be parsed; the
      concatenation of several strings is used in order to
      generate a string that can reasonably be expected to
      be unique.
 
      This code is assigned by the originator of the data set and
      is used for references between different CIF blocks.
      The ID will normally be created when the block is first
      created. It is possible to loop more than one ID for a
      block: if changes or additions are made to the
      block later, a new ID may be assigned, but the original name
      should be retained.
 
      The format for the ID code is:
        <date-time>|<block_name>|<creator_name>|<instr_name>
 
       <date-time>    is the date and time the CIF was created
                      or modified.
 
       <block_name>   is an arbitrary name assigned by the
                      originator of the data set. It will
                      usually match the name of the phase
                      and possibly the name of the current CIF
                      data block (i.e. the string xxxx in a
                      data_xxxx identifier). It may be a sample name.
 
       <creator_name> is the name of the person who measured the
                      diffractogram, or prepared or modified the CIF.
 
       <instr_name>  is a unique name (as far as possible) for
                      the data-collection instrument, preferably
                      containing the instrument serial number for
                      commercial instruments. It is also possible to
                      use the Internet name or address for the
                      instrument computer as a unique name.
 
      As blocks are created in a CIF, the original sample identifier
      (i.e. <block_name>) should be retained, but the <creator_name>
      may be changed and the <date-time> will always change.
      The <date-time> will usually match either the
      _pd_meas_datetime_initiated or the _pd_proc_info_datetime
      entry.
 
      Within each section of the code, the following characters
      may be used:
                    A-Z a-z 0-9 # & * . : , - _ + / ( ) \ [ ]\
 
      The sections are separated with vertical rules '|' which are
      not allowed within the sections. Blank spaces may also
      not be used.  Capitalization may be used within the ID code
      but should not be considered significant - searches for
      data-set ID names should be case-insensitive.
 
      Date-time entries are in the standard CIF format
      'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+zz' Use of seconds and a time zone
      is optional, but use of hours and minutes is strongly
      encouraged as this will help ensure that the ID code is unique.
 
      An archive site that wishes to make CIFs available via
      the web may substitute the URL for the file containing the
      appropriate block for the final two sections of the ID
      (<creator_name> and <instr_name>). Note that this should
      not be done unless the archive site is prepared to keep the
      file available online indefinitely.

;

      _pd_calib_2theta_offset defines an offset angle (in degrees)
      used to calibrate 2\\q (as defined in _pd_meas_2theta_).
      Calibration is done by adding the offset:
 
           2\\q~calibrated~ = 2\\q~measured~ + 2\\q~offset~
 
      For cases where the _pd_calib.2theta_offset value is
      not a constant, but rather varies with 2\\q, a set
      of offset values can be supplied in a loop. In this case,
      the value where the offset has been determined can be
      specified as _pd_calib.2theta_off_point. Alternatively, a
      range where the offset is applicable can be specified using
      _pd_calib.2theta_off_min and _pd_calib.2theta_off_max.

      To facilitate more standardized use of names, the

      Peter Bayliss for the International Centre for
      Diffraction Data (ICDD) should be followed. Note that
      combinations of descriptors are separated by an
      underscore.
 
      Allowed colours are:
        colourless, white, black, gray, brown, red, pink,
        orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.
 
      Colours may be modified using prefixes of:
        light, dark, whitish, blackish, grayish, brownish,
        reddish, pinkish, orangish, yellowish, greenish, bluish.
 
      Intermediate hues may be indicated with two colours:
      e.g. blue_green or bluish_green.
 
      For metallic materials, the term metallic may be added:
      e.g. reddish_orange_metallic for copper.
 
      The ICDD standard allows commas to be used for minerals
      that occur with ranges of colours; however this usage is
      not appropriate for the description of a single sample.

      The PD_DATA category contains raw, processed and calculated
      data points in a diffraction data set. In many cases, it is
      convenient to tabulate calculated values against the
      raw and processed measurements, and so the various
      _pd_meas_, _pd_proc_ and _pd_calc_ data items belonging
      to this category may be looped together. In some instances,
      however, it makes more sense to maintain separate tables of
      the data contributing to the measured and processed
      diffractograms (for example, a profile may be calculated
      at 2theta values different from those of the measured
      data points). To facilitate the identification of equivalent
      points in these separate tables, separate identifiers are
      defined.

      This section contains information relevant to the instrument
      used for the diffraction measurement. For most laboratories,
      very little of this information will change, so a standard file
      may be prepared and included with each data set.
 
      Note that several definitions in the core CIF dictionary
      are relevant here. For example, use:
        _diffrn_radiation_wavelength for the source wavelength,
        _diffrn_radiation_type for the X-ray wavelength type,
        _diffrn_source for the radiation source,
        _diffrn_radiation_polarisn_ratio for the source polarization,
        _diffrn_radiation_probe for the radiation type.
      For data sets measured with partially monochromatized radiation,
      for example, where both K\\a~1~ and K\\a~2~ are present, it is\
      important that all wavelengths present are included in a
      loop_ using _diffrn_radiation_wavelength to define the
      wavelength and _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to define the
      relative intensity of that wavelength. It is required that
      _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_id also be present in the
      wavelength loop. It may also be useful to
      create a "dummy" ID to use for labelling
      peaks/reflections where the K\\a~1~ and K\\a~2~ wavelengths are\
      not resolved. Set _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to be 0 for
      such a dummy ID.
 
      In the _pd_instr_ definitions, the term monochromator refers
      to a primary beam (pre-specimen) monochromator and the term
      analyser refers to post-diffraction (post-specimen)
      monochromator.  The analyser may be fixed for specific
      wavelength or may be capable of being scanned.
 
      For multiple-detector instruments it may be necessary to loop the
      *_anal/detc or *_spec/detc values (for  _pd_instr_dist_,
      _pd_instr_divg_, _pd_instr_slit_ and  _pd_instr_soller_) with
      the detector ID's (_pd_calib_detector_id).
 
      It is strongly recommended that the core dictionary term
      _diffrn_radiation_probe (specifying the nature of the radiation
      used) is employed for all data sets.

      Indicates the method used to obtain monochromatic radiation.
      Use _pd_instr_monochr_pre_spec to describe the primary beam
      monochromator (pre-specimen monochromation). Use
      _pd_instr_monochr_post_spec to specify the
      post-diffraction analyser (post-specimen monochromation).
 
      When a monochromator crystal is used, the material and the
      indices of the Bragg reflection are specified.
 
      Note that monochromators may have either 'parallel' or
      'antiparallel' orientation. It is assumed that the
      geometry is parallel unless specified otherwise.
      In a parallel geometry, the position of the monochromator
      allows the incident beam and the final post-specimen
      and post-monochromator beam to be as close to parallel
      as possible. In a parallel geometry, the diffracting
      planes in the specimen and monochromator will be parallel
      when 2\\q~monochromator~ is equal to 2\\q~specimen~.\

      Indicates the method used to obtain monochromatic radiation.
      Use _pd_instr_monochr_pre_spec to describe the primary beam
      monochromator (pre-specimen monochromation). Use
      _pd_instr_monochr_post_spec to specify the
      post-diffraction analyser (post-specimen monochromation).
 
      When a monochromator crystal is used, the material and the
      indices of the Bragg reflection are specified.
 
      Note that monochromators may have either 'parallel' or
      'antiparallel' orientation. It is assumed that the
      geometry is parallel unless specified otherwise.
      In a parallel geometry, the position of the monochromator
      allows the incident beam and the final post-specimen
      and post-monochromator beam to be as close to parallel
      as possible. In a parallel geometry, the diffracting
      planes in the specimen and monochromator will be parallel
      when 2\\q~monochromator~ is equal to 2\\q~specimen~.\
      For further discussion see R. Jenkins & R. Snyder (1996).

      This section contains the measured diffractogram and information
      about the conditions used for the measurement of the diffraction
      data set, prior to processing and application of correction
      terms. While additional information may be added to the CIF
      as data are processed and transported between laboratories
      (possibly with the addition of a new _pd_block_id entry), the
      information in this section of the CIF will rarely be changed
      once data collection is complete.
 
      Where possible, measurements in this section should have no
      post-collection processing applied (normalizations, corrections,
      smoothing, zero-offset corrections etc.). Such corrected
      measurements should be recorded in the _pd_proc_ section.
 
      Data sets that are measured as counts, where a standard
      uncertainty can be considered equivalent to the standard
      deviation and where the standard deviation can be estimated
      as the square root of the number of counts recorded, should
      use the _pd_meas_counts_ fields. All other intensity values
      should be recorded using _pd_meas_intensity_.

      experiments, use _pd_meas.2theta_fixed. In the case of
      continuous-scan data sets, the 2\\q value should be the
      value at the midpoint of the counting period. Associated
      with each _pd_meas.2theta_scan value will be
      _pd_meas.counts_* items. The 2\\q values should
      not be corrected for nonlinearity,
      zero offset etc. Corrected values may be specified
      using _pd_proc.2theta_corrected.
 
      Note that for data sets collected with constant step size,
      _pd_meas.2theta_range_ (*_min, *_max and *_inc) may be
      used instead of _pd_meas.2theta_scan.

      as a direct observable, such as from a microdensitometer
      trace from film or a strip chart recorder. This is an
      alternative to _pd_meas_2theta_scan, which should only be

      against 2\\q. For instruments where the position scale\
      is nonlinear, the data item _pd_meas_detector_id should
      be used to record positions.
 
      Calibration information, such as angle offsets or a
      function to convert this distance to a 2\\q angle\
      or d-space, should be supplied with the _pd_calib_ values.
 
      Do not confuse this with the instrument geometry
      descriptions given by _pd_instr_dist_.

      This section contains peak information extracted from the
      measured or, if present, the processed diffractogram. Each
      peak in this table will have a unique label (see _pd_peak_id).
      The reflections and phases associated with each peak will be
      specified in other sections (see the _pd_refln_ and
      _pd_phase_ sections).
 
      Note that peak positions are customarily determined from the
      processed diffractogram and thus corrections for position
      and intensity will have been previously applied.

      Inclusion of s.u.'s for these values is strongly recommended.
      If the background is estimated for a limited number of points
      and the calculated background is then extrapolated from
      these fixed points, indicate the background values for
      these points with _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_fix. Use a value
      of '.' for data points where a fixed background has not
      been defined. The extrapolated background at every point
      may be specified using _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc.
 
      Background values should be on the same scale as the
      _pd_proc_intensity_net values. Thus normalization and
      correction factors should be applied before
      background subtraction (or should be applied to the
      background values equally).

      incident intensity as a function of a data-collection

      Description of the background treatment mechanism used to

      For refinements where the background is computed as a
      function that is fitted to minimize the difference between
      the observed and calculated patterns, it is
      recommended that in addition to a description of the
      function (e.g. Chebychev polynomial), the actual equation(s)
      used are included in TeX, or a programming language such
      as Fortran or C. Include also the values used for the
      coefficients used in the background function with their
      s.u.'s. The background values for each data point
      computed from the function should be specified in
      _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc.
 
      If background correction is performed using extrapolation
      from a set of points at fixed locations, these points
      should be defined using _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_fix, and
      _pd_proc_ls_background_function should indicate the
      extrapolation method (linear extrapolation, spline etc.).
      _pd_proc_ls_background_function should also indicate how the
      points were determined (automatically, by visual estimation
      etc.) and whether the values were refined to improve the
      agreement. The extrapolated background intensity value for
      each data point should be specified in
      _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc.

       Note that in the above equations,
          w(i) is the weight for the ith data point (see
               _pd_proc_ls_weight).
          I~obs~(i) is the observed intensity for the ith data
               point, sometimes referred to as y~i~(obs) or
               y~oi~. (See _pd_meas_counts_total,
               _pd_meas_intensity_total or _pd_proc_intensity_total.)
          I~calc~(i) is the computed intensity for the ith data

     _pd_proc_ls.prof_wR_expected, sometimes called the
       theoretical R~wp~ or R~exp~, is a weighted fitness metric for
       the statistical precision of the data set. For an idealized fit,
       where all deviations between the observed intensities and
       those computed from the model are due to statistical
       fluctuations, the observed R~wp~ should match the expected
       R factor. In reality, R~wp~ will always be higher than
       R~exp~.
         R~exp~ = SQRT { (n - p)  / sum~i~ ( w(i) [I~obs~(i)]^2^ ) }

      Rietveld/profile fit R factors.
 
      Note that the R factor computed for Rietveld refinements
      using the extracted reflection intensity values (often
      called the Rietveld or Bragg R factor, R~B~) is not properly
      a profile R factor. This R factor may be specified using
      _refine_ls.R_I_factor. (Some authors report
      _refine_ls.R_Fsqd_factor or _refine_ls_R_factor_all
      as the Rietveld or Bragg R factor. While it is appropriate
      to compute and report any or all of these R factors,
      the names "Rietveld or Bragg R factor" refer strictly to
      _refine_ls.R_I_factor.)
 
     _pd_proc_ls.prof_wR_factor, often called R~wp~, is a
       weighted fitness metric for the agreement between the
       observed and computed diffraction patterns.
         R~wp~ = SQRT {\
                  sum~i~ ( w(i) [ I~obs~(i) - I~calc~(i) ]^2^ )
                  / sum~i~ ( w(i) [I~obs~(i)]^2^ ) }\
 
       Note that in the above equations,
          w(i) is the weight for the ith data point (see
               _pd_proc_ls_weight).
          I~obs~(i) is the observed intensity for the ith data
               point, sometimes referred to as y~i~(obs) or
               y~oi~. (See _pd_meas_counts_total,
               _pd_meas_intensity_total or _pd_proc_intensity_total.)
          I~calc~(i) is the computed intensity for the ith data
               point with background and other corrections
               applied to match the scale of the observed data set,
               sometimes referred to as y~i~(calc) or
               y~ci~. (See _pd_calc_intensity_total.)
          n is the total number of data points (see
               _pd_proc_number_of_points) less the number of
               data points excluded from the refinement.
          p is the total number of refined parameters.
